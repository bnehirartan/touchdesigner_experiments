# Audio Reactive Voxels

This project explores the creation of **audio-reactive voxel ripple effects** using **TouchDesigner**. It generates real-time effects that respond to the beat and rhythm of the sound.

The project uses **3D voxel graphics** that ripple and distort in response to the audio's frequency and volume, creating a fluid, interactive visual display.

This project was developed with guidance from **Dean Cheesman** tutorials.
