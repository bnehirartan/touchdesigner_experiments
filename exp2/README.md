This project aims to explore how point cloud effects are made using **TouchDesigner**, with a focus on sci-fi aesthetics. It was made with the help of The Interactive & Immersive HQ tutorials.  

Point cloud effects allow for the manipulation of 3D data to generate dynamic, immersive visuals that can be used in various interactive and artistic installations.
