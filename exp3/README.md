# Interactive Cloud

This project creates an interactive, cloud-like object that reacts to movement detected by a regular webcam. The object starts to **lighten up** and mimics the effect of a **flame** or **lightning strike** whenever movement is detected in the camera's field of view. 

The effect is dynamic and responsive. It behaves as a reactive visual that is influenced by human motion.

The project uses real-time input from the webcam to trigger changes in the visual behavior of the cloud-like object.
